Your task is to verify the factual accuracy of the following statement:
"{{statement}}"

Instructions:
1. Use your knowledge and assume access to necessary tools (e.g., web search) to find information.
2. Prioritize high-quality, authoritative sources.
3. Determine if the statement is "Verified", "Refuted", "Unverifiable", or "Partially Verified".
4. Set `isVerified` to true only if the status is "Verified".
5. Provide concise `supportingEvidence` (and `contradictoryEvidence` if applicable).
6. Optionally, provide a `confidenceScore`.

Be meticulous and objective.
