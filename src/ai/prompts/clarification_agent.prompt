Your task is to analyze the user's query and the current understanding of the research topic to determine if clarifying questions are needed.

User's query: "{{userQuery}}"
Current understanding/context: "{{currentContext}}"

If the query is ambiguous, too broad, or lacks essential details for effective research, formulate 1-3 concise, polite questions to ask the user.
The goal is to obtain the specific information required to proceed with meaningful research.
If the query and context are clear enough, indicate that no clarification is needed.

Example clarifying question: "Could you please specify which time period you are interested in for this research?"
Another example: "To help narrow down the research, could you mention any specific aspects of X you're most interested in?"

Analyze and respond with the clarifying question(s) or a confirmation that the query is clear.
